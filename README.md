# FinalProject

## Executive Summary 
After 33 weeks in the Data Science Program at Southern Careers Institute Powered by Woz-U, it is now time for the Final Project. This project will be completed over 6 weeks (7/10/2022 - 8/21/2022) and will be presented to the instructor in order to graduate from the program. These finals are usually done in groups, but I have chosen to work it solo for the full experience. This document will explain the purpose and scope of my project.

## Business Objectives
I will be executing and discussing the many skills I have acquired while in this Data Science program. R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and other programs will be used to collect, wrangle, analyze, and vizualize the "Data Salaries" dataset made available by Ruchi Bhatia on Kaggle. Once this project is complete, I will be able to fully explain my work by presenting my findings to faculty and staff, peers, and potential employers. 

## Background
This project is not only a requirement for graduation, but what better way to show off your skills than putting what you know into a meaningful project?! The end goal is to land a Data Science role upon graduation so I have chosen the "Data Salaries" dataset. I am interested in the different data position titles and the different salaries associated with experience level. 

## Scope
I will be using the software that I was taught in my Data Science program to complete this project. I will be intentional on using tools of my interest AND tools that will aid in finding employment. Additional tools not taught may be used, but are not required. 

## Functional requirements
Data Wrangling: The downloaded dataset will be cleaned for proper analysis. 

Data Analysis: The dataset rows and columns will be fully understood to anwer the following questions: 
- What are the pay differences for experience levels for the top 3 data jobs for each year?
- Has there been a change in remote work salary over the years?

Any other additional questions that come up can and will be added for exploration. The correct analysis will be determined based on the purpose of the analysis, which is drawing conclusions and making predictions.

Data Vizualizations: Once the insights have been gathered from the dataset, I will use Tableau to visualize my findings. All findings will be made into a PowerPoint slideshow.

Presentation: On my 6th and final weekly meeting with my instructor, I will be presenting this project live via Zoom. I will clearly communicate my findings and answer any questions that any spectators may have. 

## Personnel requirements
Since I am doing this project alone, I will be the Scrum Master each week. Every Tuesday I will meet with my instructor (Product Owner) to ask any questions and to make sure I am on track with completing this project on time. 

## Delivery Schedule
Week 1-Project Planning 

Week 2-Data Wrangling

Week 3-Exploratory Analysis

Week 4-Analyze Data

Week 5-Data Visualization and Reporting

Week 6-Prep/Presentation

## Assumptions
All software programs used for this project should still be free of charge and should be up-to-date.

## Limitations
If more data is found and many more questions arise, there could be a delay in the deadline. Any unscheduled time off from the instructor or missed weekly meetings from me could also cause a potential delay.

## Risks
Unforeseen situations sometimes come out of the blue when things need to be done by a certain time. Family emergencies, hardware/software issues, power outages, etc could be risks faced during this time. The risk of loss of motivation are not in the picture as I am ready to knock this project out of the park! 

# Thank you for reading this far and I hope you love my Final Project just as much as I will love completing it!
